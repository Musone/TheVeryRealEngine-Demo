# TheVeryRealEngine-Demo
An engine I built for video game enthusiasts to mod their favourite computer games with. It comes with a read and write API to externally manipulate game memory, as-well as a graphics API built using D2D1. This demo includes usage a Sea of Thieves mod as an example using my mod engine.

Video demo coming soon!
